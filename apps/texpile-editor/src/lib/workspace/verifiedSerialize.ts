// The save check: the file a document was written to must parse back to that document. That is
// the second law of the round trip (see blockAssembly.ts); the first, that an untouched document
// writes its file back byte for byte, holds by construction. When the file fails it, the blame
// lies in a block that was written from the document, since every other block is the file's own
// bytes, or in one whose bytes read otherwise now that the edit took out what they referred to
// (a link's definition): those blocks are written out whole instead of patched inside, then their
// neighbours with them, and the file checked again. What still reads as it did is never regenerated.
